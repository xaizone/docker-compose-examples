# Docker Quake Live CA (Clan Arena) server

Setting up a Quake Live Clan Arena server is now as simple as adjusting `server.cfg` and running `docker compose up -d`.

This example comes with minqlx pre-installed and modern, standardized server plugins, like ELO balancing and Queue system.

# Setup

Parameters to change in `server.cfg`:
 - qlx_owner
 - zmq_rcon_password
 - zmq_stats_password

If you would like to have a minimum ELO limit, adjust `qlx_elo_limit_min` to your liking.
