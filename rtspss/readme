If you run this without traefik, you will need to provide certs for low latency HLS to work (or to even launch the container correctly) in `rtsp-simple-server.yml`, alternatively you can change the hlsVariant variable (line 140) to `mpegts`

Also don't forget to change line 262 and 265 to something more secure!

# OBS Setup

Open Settings -> Stream and change the following settings:

- Service: Custom...
- Server: rtmp://example.com
- Stream key: <name>?user=user&pass=verysecurepassword

Now if you go live, you will be able to access your stream with the following:
- https://example.com/<name> (HLS)
- rtmp://example.com/<name> (RTMP)
